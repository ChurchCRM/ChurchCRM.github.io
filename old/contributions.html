        <p >ChurchCRM is a branch off of two former open source projects. About 10 years ago, a
            program called <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/infocentral/" target="_blank">InfoCentral</a>
            was created and, after a few upgrades, was soon  renamed
            <a href="http://www.churchdb.org/" target="_blank"> ChurchInfo</a>.</p>
        <p >After examining the inner workings of these two platforms, weâ€™ve taken it to the next
            level with ChurchCRM by adding new features and bringing it up to speed with modern application
            development techniques here on <a href="https://github.com/ChurchCRM/CRM" target="_blank">GitHub</a>!
